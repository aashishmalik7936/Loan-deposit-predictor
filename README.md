# Loan-deposit-predictor

## Introduction
This project utilizes the marketing data of a Portuguese commercial bank to understand the customers behavior using machine learning models. To create the model, the bankâ€™s data containing the past behavior, habits and traits of all the customers are feeded into a machine learning model in the expectation of better understanding how customers will behave in future. In this project, a classifier is built using machine learning algorithms that predicts whether the customer will subscribe to a long term deposit or not based on the input data that has been used to make the model.

## Tools and libraries 
Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, GridSearchCV.

## Algorithms
Logistic Regression, K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Support Vector Machine.

## Result
The machine learning models performed satisfactorily in predicting the behavior of the customers of the bank by utilizing the data. The best model i.e. AdaBoost Classifier predicted the test data with the accuracy of 90.333% which shows that the Portuguese bank can utilize this model to find those customers who will most likely subscribe to their long term deposit with the average success rate of 9 out 10. This model will save the cost for the company and the saved money can be better used towards those customers who are more likely to subscribe to the long term deposit service. The model is beneficial for the company because of two reasons, first it helps in reducing the cash burn for the bank, second is that this model helps in fetching those customers which will subscribe for the long term deposit which will increase the revenue as well as long term liquidity for the bank.
