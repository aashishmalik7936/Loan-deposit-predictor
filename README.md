# Loan-deposit-predictor

This project utilizes the marketing data of a Portuguese commercial bank to understand the customers behavior using machine learning models. To create the model, the bankâ€™s data containing the past behavior, habits and traits of all the customers are feeded into a machine learning model in the expectation of better understanding how customers will behave in future. 
In this project, a classifier is built using machine learning algorithms that predicts whether the customer will subscribe to a long term deposit or not based on the input data that has been used to make the model.
